    "* like calling an Task1, Task2, Task3 etc.\n",

    "**Types of Chaining**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extend or Sequential Chaining**: This is the most common type of chaining where each task is executed one by one in a straight/sequential line\n",
    "   *Example*: Task1 -> Task2 -> Task3 etc (Do task in sequence)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parallel Chaining**: This type of chaining allows you to execute multiple tasks in parallel, which can significantly speed up the execution\n",
    "    *Example*: TServe breakfast with coffee , toast and fried egg at the same time. (Do multiple task at the same time Parallel) \n",
    "     * *Task 1*: Brewing Coffee\n",
    "     * *Task 2*: Toasting Bread\n",
    "     * *Task 3*: Cooking Fried Egg\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conditional Chaining**: This type of chaining allows you to execute tasks based on certain conditions.\n",
    "    *Example*: If condition is true then execute Task1 else execute Task2 etc (Do task based on condition)"

      "\n",
      "1.  **Cats have a specialized collarbone:** Unlike humans, a cat's collarbone isn't connected to its skeleton. It's embedded in their shoulder muscles, which allows them to squeeze through incredibly small spaces.\n",
      "2.  **Cats can make over 100 different sounds:** In contrast, dogs can only make about 10.\n",
      "3.  **Cats sleep a lot:** On average, cats spend about 12-16 hours a day sleeping. This helps them conserve energy for hunting.\n",
      "4.  **Cats have a third eyelid:** Called a nictitating membrane, this eyelid helps to keep the eye lubricated and protected.\n",
      "5.  **A cat's nose print is unique:** Just like human fingerprints, no two cats have the same nose print pattern.\n"
