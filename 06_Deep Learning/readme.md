# Deep Learning Playground üß†‚ú®

This repository contains beginner-to-intermediate level implementations of popular deep learning models using TensorFlow/Keras:

- üñºÔ∏è **CNN** (Convolutional Neural Network)
- üßæ **RNN** (Simple Recurrent Neural Network)
- üß† **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory)
- üé® **GAN** (Generative Adversarial Network)

Each notebook follows a **full data science pipeline**:
- Data Loading & Preprocessing
- Model Building (with detailed comments)
- Training with Validation
- Visualization of Results
- Prediction & Evaluation
